		<p>
			Established in 1959 in Old Kampala, the Aga Khan High School, Kampala was the first multicultural school in
			Uganda. The present day school continues to play a unique educational role in the country.
		</p>

		<!-- <p>

		The Aga Khan High School, Kampala propels its students to become top performers nationally and internationally, by adopting the best international and contemporary teaching and learning as well as educational leadership philosophies. The School offers both National and International curriculums.

		</p>

		<p>

			The Aga Khan Schools strive to create a harmonious balance between academic demands, sporting and cultural activities and community life. They challenge pupils to be intellectually inquisitive and socially conscious. The School believes that while what students know is important, the true measure of a student's education is the ability to analyse what they do not know.

		</p>

		<p>

			The School is part of the Aga Khan Education Services (AKES). AKES has a long tradition of leadership in educational development. The foundations of the present system were laid by Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah, Aga Khan III, under whose guidance over 200 schools were established during the first half of the 20th century. The first schools were established around 1905 in Zanzibar, Gwadar (Pakistan), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and Mundra (India)
